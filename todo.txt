    - By 'liked: false' or 'liked: true'.
      - Each psychologist (from the /api/psychologists) should have its respective value based on the user (if there is no user at all, the 'liked' values should be always *false*).
    - Implement the possiblity to score psychologists by stars.

        - The stars score will be an average from the total scores.
